### Language Proficiency
 
- Python
- Java
- C#
- Sh/Bash/Zsh
- HTML/PHP/SQL

### Workspace

Console and Vim are my main workflow tools. For large projects I lean towards
the JetBrains software suite (PyCharm, IDEA, and CLion), mainly for code
optimization reminders, quicker error checking/debugging, navigating
definitions (especially if they're foreign), and code large completion.

### Current Projects
 
- Virtual assistant using machine learning through PyTorch
- Automated C# Twitter bot
- Begin C/C++ education
