### Language Proficiency
 
- Python
- Java
- C++/C#
- Sh/Bash/Zsh
- HTML/PHP/SQL

### Workspace

Console and Vim are my main workflow tools. For large projects I lean towards
the JetBrains software suite (PyCharm, IDEA, and CLion), mainly for code
optimization reminders, quicker error checking/debugging, navigating
definitions (especially if they're foreign), and code large completion.

### Current Projects
 
Github profile organization, language portfolios, detailed READMEs per main 
directory, continuing a-py-a-day pushes

### Current Focus

Deeper understanding of git's functionality, machine learning through Python,
realtime image recognition with iPhone
