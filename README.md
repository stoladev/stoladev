## MAIN INFO

### Language Proficiency

### Workspace

Console and Vim are my main workflow tools. For large projects I lean towards
the JetBrains software suite (PyCharm, IDEA, and CLion), mainly for code
optimization reminders, quicker error checking/debugging, navigating
definitions (especially if they're foreign), and code large completion.

### Current Projects
 
- Github profile organization
- Language portfolios
- Detailed READMEs per main directory
- Continuing a-py-a-day

### Current Focus

- Deeper understanding of git's functionality
- Machine learning through Python
- Realtime image recognition with iPhone

## EXTRA INFO

### What Should I Call You?

Mike, or if you know too many Mikes (which is likely the case), Stolarz works
just fine. Some even use Stola.

### How My Tech Passion Started 

I've been interested in programming ever since sixth grade, starting with
private servers for RuneScape. It exposed me to my first programming language
(Java), an IDE (Eclipse), and the open-source movement. 

After being exposed to a few forums that had a main focus on software
development, I started my first business doing traffic mitigation at the age of
fifteen. While this unfortunately led to my PayPal getting suspended until I
turned eighteen, I both made a couple bucks and learned what my passion was:
software. 

Making ideas work, so long as I was smart enough to execute the necessary steps
correctly, became my approach to life.
