### Language Proficiency
 
- Python
- Java
- C#

- HTML/PHP/SQL

### Workspace

Console and Vim are my main workflow tools. For large projects I lean towards
the JetBrains software suite (PyCharm, IDEA, and CLion). I aim to always use
the cutting edge when it comes to productivity and efficiency, so changes are
bound to be made to my toolset to fit the project I'm working on.

### Current Projects
 
- Virtual assistant using machine learning through PyTorch
- Learn Rust and its usefulness for machine learning
